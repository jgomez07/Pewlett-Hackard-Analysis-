Pewllet Hackard should consider opening up more Assistant Engineer positions and promoting the current Assistant Engineers to the Senior level in preparation for the “silver tsunami”.

Additional information that would prove useful for this investigation would be to survey the senior employees on their retirement plans. Analyzing that data would give provide useful information as to retirement timeframes thus when new positions would open at Pewllet Hackard.
